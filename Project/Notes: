Notes:
	We will be on the server side. He can send us code that shows us how this works out
	For the first pass stay with the user and then worry about socets
	The I/O primitives of the language will be the same I/O primitives for the socet 

	to print something while also returning none we can just do a simple (print str ; NONE)
	To do something with it we are going to have to step out of the option type. more probably are going to have to make our own option type (recreate SOME NONE)
