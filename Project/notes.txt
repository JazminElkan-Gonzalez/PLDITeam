Notes:
	We will be on the server side. He can send us code that shows us how this works out
	For the first pass stay with the user and then worry about sockets
	The I/O primitives of the language will be the same I/O primitives for the socket 

	to print something while also returning none we can just do a simple (print str ; NONE)
	To do something with it we are going to have to step out of the option type. more probably are going to have to make our own option type (recreate SOME NONE)

	Could we do a wrapper function? That would handle the calling of all the functions and remove the concern over having to pass along a variable from function to function to keep track of the progress of the program.
